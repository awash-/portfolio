# Alex's Data Visualization + Analytics Portfolio
I really should keep a portfolio ✨ online ✨, so here she is!

Here, I outline concepts from major projects I've worked on and vizzes I've created. Much of my work is unavailable to show detailed methodology for, but this repo is just for illustrative purposes.

## Projects Showcased
**Love & Money: Views on Financial Stability and Commitment Prior to Marriage** <br>
*Data visualization x Tableau*

I'm not one to be obsessed with data, but I have a confession to make: I enjoy reading well-researched lit concerning the potential global baby bust. The interest is personal as I'm a legally single woman with no intention of marrying or having children. I wondered, then, how others' views may differ based on geography, sex, marital status, and sexual orientation. So I downloaded some pre-cleaned Pew data (ATP Wave 50) and plopped it into Tableau. It's not going to inspire anyone to do anything, but it makes great dinner conversation if your friends are nerds.

**Highway Safety: Fatal Accidents and Characteristics 2014-2019** <br>
*Data visualization x Tableau*
When I got my start as a Transportation Analyst consultant, I worked with highway safety data. For a time I knew the FARS interface like the back of my hand. I provided data visualizations that went into Highway Safety Plans in states such as West Virginia, Virgnia, Ohio, and Florida. I'm sure I'm forgetting several. Anyway, check this out if you want to be radicalized into #VisionZero.

**Workflow: Wrangling CSVs into Postgres** <br>
*Walkthrough x SQL (via Markdown)*
As a freelance geospatial analyst, I got to leverage PostgresSQL to take my clients from disparate spreadsheets to a full blown database! This client was looking for a scalable way to store their growing data, that would also be compatible with ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Pro. Postgres was my immediate go-to: open-source, assistive GUI (pgadmin), and PostGIS are critical to this project. Ultimately I want to empower the client to be able to run their own small queries (hence the importance of pgadmin) and we are actively researching cloud hosting options.
