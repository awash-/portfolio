# Alex's Data Visualization + Analytics Portfolio
I really should keep a portfolio ✨ online ✨

## Elevator Spiel
Here, I outline concepts from major projects I've worked on and vizzes I've created. Much of my work is unavailable to show detailed methodology for, but this repo is just for illustrative purposes.

## Projects Showcased
** Love & Money: Views on Financial Stability and Commitment Prior to Marriage ** || Data visualization || Tableau
I'm not one to be obsessed with data, but I have a confession to make: I enjoy reading well-researched lit concerning the potential global baby bust. The interest is personal as I'm a legally single woman with no intention of marrying or having children. I wondered, then, how others' views may differ based on geography, sex, marital status, and sexual orientation. So I downloaded some pre-cleaned Pew data (ATP Wave 50) and plopped it into Tableau. It's not going to inspire anyone to do anything, but it makes great dinner conversation if your friends are nerds.

** Highway Safety: Fatal Accidents and Characteristics 2014-2019 ** || Data visualization || Tableau
When I got my start as a Transportation Analyst consultant, I worked with highway safety data. For a time I knew the FARS interface like the back of my hand. I provided data visualizations that went into Highway Safety Plans in states such as West Virginia, Virgnia, Ohio, and Florida. I'm sure I'm forgetting several. Anyway, check this out if you want to be radicalized into #VisionZero.

** Workflow: Wrangling CSVs into Postgres ** || Walkthrough || SQL
As a freelance geospatial analyst, I got to leverage PostgresSQL to take my clients from disparate spreadsheets to a full blown database! I don't want to give away too much, so just check out my walkthrough.
